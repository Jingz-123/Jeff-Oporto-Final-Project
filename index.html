            <small>Why this matters</small>
          </div>
          <p><strong>What entrepreneurship means to me:</strong> To me, entrepreneurship is more than just starting a business it is a mindset and a way of approaching life. Entrepreneurship means seeing opportunities where others might see problems, and being willing to take the initiative to create solutions. It involves creativity, critical thinking, and the courage to take calculated risks.

                    Entrepreneurship also represents independence and responsibility. It means taking ownership of my ideas, learning from failures, and continuously improving myself. It pushes me to be resourceful, resilient, and adaptable in a world that is always changing.

                    Most importantly, entrepreneurship is about creating value. Whether through products, services, or innovations, entrepreneurs aim to make a positive impact on people and communities. For me, entrepreneurship is the drive to imagine something better and the commitment to make it happen.</p>
                    <br> 
          <p><strong> Why personality & risk traits matter: </strong> Personality and risk traits matter because they shape the way we think, behave, and solve problems. In entrepreneurship, every decision whether small or big depends on how a person deals with pressure, uncertainty, and opportunities. Knowing your traits helps you understand your strengths, improve weak areas, and choose the right strategies for your future career or business. It also helps you identify what type of work style, partners, or business environment fits you best.</p>

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <small>Interpretation</small>
          </div>

          <p> <strong> Conscientiousness: </strong> Being organized, reliable, responsible, and having a strong work ethic. It is crucial for executing plans and maintaining business standards. </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong> Personal Experience: </strong> During my time managing a local sports league, I took over a position known for disorganization. I developed a master schedule and checklist system for equipment, venue booking, and volunteer communication. My meticulous tracking ensured that, for the first time in three years, no games were cancelled due to scheduling conflicts or missing resources. This demonstrates my ability to build reliable operational systems, a key skill for any successful business. </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong> Openness to Experience: </strong> Involves being imaginative, insightful, having a wide range of interests, and being willing to engage with new ideas or concepts. It is vital for innovation and adapting to market changes. </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong> Personal Experience: </strong> For a volunteer project focused on local history, the traditional method was a static website. Recognizing the need to reach a younger audience, I proposed and led the creation of an interactive, virtual tour accessible via QR codes placed at historical sites. Although I had to quickly learn basic mapping software and coordinate content in a new format, the willingness to embrace this unproven, novel solution dramatically increased community engagement and media attention for the project. </p>

              <h4> Risk Profile: </h4>
              <p>My risk tolerance: <span class="risk-pill"> Moderate risk-taker </span><br> I do not avoid risk entirely but prefer calculated risks over blind leaps of faith. In a business context, this translates to a preference for thoroughly researched opportunities that offer a good return on investment while maintaining a stable foundation and clear strategies for mitigating potential downsides. My approach prioritizes sustainable, controlled growth. </p>

              <p> My entrepreneurial traits and my moderate risk profile significantly impact my potential by positioning me for calculated, sustainable growth. This approach minimizes catastrophic failure but requires vigilance to ensure I don't become too cautious. </p>
